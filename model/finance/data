To design a database for the **Finance Management Module** of a school ERP or LMS system using **Mongoose**, we need to define various entities that will represent different aspects of the school's financial operations. These entities will cover fee collection, spending, fee structures, and tracking learner fee records.

### Entities and Attributes for School Finance Management

### Relationships Between Entities

- **Fee Structure** and **Learner Fee Record**: A `Fee Structure` is referenced in a `Learner Fee Record` to determine the applicable fees.
- **Fee Transaction** and **Learner Fee Record**: A `Learner Fee Record` can have multiple `Fee Transactions` associated with it.
- **Expenditure** and **Budget**: Expenditures are tracked against the relevant `Budget` to monitor spending.
